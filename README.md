CodSoft Internship Program Tasks for Machine Learning 

Name:Sanjana Gaherwar

College:MIT-WPU 

Completed 3 tasks in which we were expexted to built 3 machine learning models which are :

# Task 1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Built a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. By using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machine.

# Tasks 3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Developed a  Machine Learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business using historical customer data.

# Task 4: SPAM SMS DETECTION
Built an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
